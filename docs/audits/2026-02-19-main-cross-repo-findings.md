### Notable shifts since last audit

1. Site now has production analytics wiring and benchmark evidence pages backed by synced snapshots.
2. Animation safety checks are runnable and passing in canonical and fixture modes.
3. Phase 1 hardening resolved benchmark source integrity, release immutability enforcement, and sync-token exposure risks.
4. Phase 2 resolved CLI module/runtime contract fragility by moving to ESM-primary packaging with dual export conditions.
5. Phase 2 resolved missing public runner API by shipping stable `@imageforge/cli/runner` with import/require matrix coverage.
6. Phase 3 resolved site UI/motion regression gaps by adding advisory Vitest, Playwright E2E/visual, and LHCI quality gates.
7. Phase 4 restored CI health on both repos and stabilized benchmark-sync formatting with fail-closed producer normalization.
8. Phase 5 added runtime safety hardening (sanitized CLI path logging + chunked hashing) and resolved site header/dependency hardening.
9. Phase 6A decomposed runner/test monoliths and closed targeted edge-case validation gaps in CLI.
10. Phase 6A added advisory coverage artifacts and targeted fault-injection pilots in both repos.
11. Cross-repo workflow action pinning remains enforced via CI policy checks in both repositories.
12. Phase 6B resolved SEO signal-noise findings, added blocking pricing freshness enforcement, and moved benchmark regression gates to mixed strictness policy.
13. Phase 6C resolved CLI runtime/DX/hygiene items (Node >=20 policy, dry-run/include/exclude/init, helper dedup, one-shot E2E) and closed site docs/contact IA.
14. Phase 6D added CLI mutation-testing advisory signal with published mutation artifacts and CI summary output.

## Top 10 Highest-Severity Findings

1. `IF-X-TEST-032` (Medium) - Cross-repo validation now includes CLI mutation advisory signal, but mutation policy remains advisory and incomplete across repos.
2. `IF-CLI-PROD-005` (Medium) - Runtime source-format support still excludes webp/avif/svg despite clarified roadmap sequencing.
3. `IF-SITE-PROD-017` (Low) - Benchmark evidence route is new and needs ongoing governance discipline for freshness and attribution.
4. `IF-SITE-UX-022` (Low) - Animation safety gates are now active and should remain strict for core safety checks.

## Critical-Path Remediation Order

1. Expand mutation effectiveness from advisory to policy-backed governance across both repos before declaring validation depth closure: `IF-X-TEST-032`.
2. Execute the documented source-input roadmap with explicit contracts and tests for webp/avif/svg source processing: `IF-CLI-PROD-005`.
3. Preserve and monitor newly added site signal surfaces (benchmark evidence + animation safety) so governance remains durable: `IF-SITE-PROD-017`, `IF-SITE-UX-022`.
