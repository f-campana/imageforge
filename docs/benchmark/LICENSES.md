# Benchmark Dataset Licensing

## Licensing Model

Benchmark assets are assembled from:

1. Open-license source images (tracked with attribution and license metadata).
2. Synthetic images generated by ImageForge tooling.

## Source Register

Source metadata lives in:

- `scripts/bench/dataset-sources.json`

Each source entry should include:

- source URL
- license
- attribution
- local filename
- optional source checksum

## Distribution Artifacts

Dataset release assets include:

- tier archives (`.tar.zst`)
- dataset manifest
- checksums

## Compliance Notes

- Do not include assets with unknown or incompatible license terms.
- Keep attribution text up to date when source list changes.
